There was once when Ms Ng suggested a class recess so that our class could bond together with her and Mdm Sim.
The class comm planned a lot of activities and the teachers also booked the dance studio specially for us.
Although the class recess was just 40 minutes long, it took the class comm a few days to think of an appopriate venue and suitable games to play.
The teachers even bought some snacks and cake for us to eat in case some of us forgot to bring food to eat.
The day before, Mdm Sim and Ms Ng reminded us multiple times of our class recess and to bring some food to eat.
The class recess turned out well and our class had a chance to bond and have fun as a class through the games played.
It was so fun that some of us were relunctant to end the games and Mdm Sim had to give up some time from her period for us to continue the games for a while more.
That was a very memorable class recess and hopefully there would be more to come after this Covid-19 situation.
